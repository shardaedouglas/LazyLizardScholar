Hello! I'm Shardae Douglas, a Senior Software Engineer with over seven years of professional experience, but my true passion lies in empowering the next generation of programmers. My own journey into technology began as a childhood fascination, nurtured by a love for knowing how things worked and a mother who taught me that through knowledge, we have the power to shape our reality. I firmly believe that technology can change the entire trajectory of a child's life—just as it did for mine.
From Code Coach to Founder
While I've built a career creating innovative software solutions, designing AI-powered applications, and developing games, one of my most cherished experiences comes from my time as a Code Coach at theCoderSchool. There, I had the privilege of teaching game development and programming to students aged 5 to 18. It was here that I solidified my teaching philosophy, which is centered on making coding accessible and exciting for everyone.
• For young learners, I introduce foundational concepts like variables, loops, and conditional statements using engaging, low-code languages like Scratch, Microsoft MakeCode, and EduBlocks.
• For advanced students, we dive into industry-standard languages such as Python, JavaScript, and C#/Unity, focusing on exciting projects in game development.
My approach is built on creating personalized learning paths and customized curriculums tailored to each student's individual learning style and goals. I don't just teach code; I mentor students through their projects, provide debugging support, and offer encouragement to help them deepen their understanding and achieve their goals.
I’ll never forget working with a young girl who was initially shy and struggling with errors in her code. After we patiently worked together, she successfully fixed the bug herself. The immense pride and genuine excitement on her face as she saw her game character finally move correctly was unforgettable. It is moments like these—witnessing a child gain confidence, conquer a complex challenge, and foster a true passion for technology—that fuel my dedication to teaching.
Real-World Experience Your Child Can Rely On
The curriculum at our school is grounded in my extensive, real-world experience as a Lead Software Engineer and professional game developer. I have led teams in software architecture, developed AI-powered applications that increased productivity by 50%, and built games using the very same tools I teach, including C#, Unity, C++, and the Unreal Engine. This ensures that your child is not just learning to code in a vacuum; they are gaining practical, relevant skills that are directly applicable to the modern tech industry.
Our Mission: A Better Future Through Code
Ultimately, my goal is to do more than just teach programming. I have a significant aspiration to establish an organization that provides technological exposure to children from impoverished neighborhoods, especially empowering young Black girls to see themselves as future leaders and innovators. I believe that "greater diversity of perspectives breeds more innovative ideas".
My vision is to create a nurturing and inspiring environment where young minds can discover the transformative power of technology. By providing foundational tools and mentorship, we can cultivate confidence, resilience, and a sense of limitless possibility, opening doors to educational and career opportunities they might never have imagined. I am committed to being a visible role model and demonstrating that anyone, regardless of their background, can succeed in tech and help build a better future for everyone
