                         <h4 class="fw-semibold mb-3">The Spark of Inspiration</h4>
                         <p class="text-muted">My journey into technology began as a childhood fascination, nurtured by a love for knowing how things worked and a mother who taught me that through knowledge, we have the power to shape our reality. I firmly believe that technology can change the entire trajectory of a child's life—just as it did for mine.</p>
                         <p class="text-muted">The moment of clarity came during my time as a Code Coach at theCoderSchool, working with a young girl who was initially shy and struggling with errors in her code. After we patiently worked together, she successfully fixed the bug herself. The immense pride and genuine excitement on her face as she saw her game character finally move correctly was unforgettable.</p>

                         <h4 class="fw-semibold mb-3">From Code Coach to Founder</h4>
                         <p class="text-muted">As a Senior Software Engineer with over seven years of professional experience, I've built innovative software solutions, designed AI-powered applications, and developed games. But my most cherished experiences come from teaching game development and programming to students aged 5 to 18.</p>
                         <p class="text-muted">I don't just teach code; I mentor students through their projects, provide debugging support, and offer encouragement to help them deepen their understanding and achieve their goals. My approach is built on creating personalized learning paths and customized curriculums tailored to each student's individual learning style and goals.</p>

We aspire to provide technological exposure to children from lower economical backgrounds empowering those children to see themselves as future leaders and innovators. We believe that greater diversity of perspectives breeds a medley of innovative ideas.</p>
